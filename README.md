# Delivery Fee Calculator

An ongoing project for practicing TypeScript, React, Vite, Vitest and CSS.

## Background

This project is based on [Wolt's preliminary assignment for summer 2024 engineering internship](https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-internship-2024).

I am eager to learn more about web development and design and I saw this project as a good opportunity to acquire some new skills related to them.

I chose to work on this project because I wanted to...

- familiarize myself with TypeScript. It is my first time using it.
- learn React better.
- work on something that had clear requirements.
- learn how to write tests and try TDD.
- learn how to make responsive and accessible web pages.
- train my mindset and see this project as iterative instead of linear.

## What the app does

The purpose of this app is to calculate a delivery fee based on four different user inputs: cart value, delivery distance, number of items and order time.

The requirements for the app can be found in the [Wolt Summer 2024 Engineering Internships repository](https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-internship-2024).
